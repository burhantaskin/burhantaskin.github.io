### CPSC 120
* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorites because we got to make a pattern using loops. During this part, I was able to write loops using lines and all of these lines were in a pattern which was the cool and appealingly pleasant part. Also, this was a fun lab because I really like making patterns and I got to learn how to make them.
* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorites because for the first time in my life, I got to make an animation. During this part, I was able to make an ASCII animation. I am really into making animations and with the help of this lab, I was able to learn how to and at the end, it was all very good looking.
* Lab 12
    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my favorites because with this lab, I made colorful GIFs. During this part, I was able to make GIFs with colors using many new functions. With this lab, I learned how to make animated GIFs and this helped me with learning new functions and will help me with making better ones in the future as I am now experienced with the programming of GIFs.
